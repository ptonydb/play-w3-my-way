# play-w3-my-way
A collection of Witcher 3 modifications, bugfixes, and UI improvements.

## Description:
The Witcher 3 is one of my favorite RPG and is the case for many other's as well. However, this masterpiece has some rough edges that I could not ignore during my playtime. Some modifications are done to improve the gameplay experience for myself and potentially others.

## Notice:
The game parses each script/bundles from the mods folder as a replacement for the existing original script. As such, mods are an -addition/modification- to the original set. Thus I do not claim ownership for entirety of said scripts or bundled game code and assets.

## List of mods (some are in progress):
* Faster Stash UI
* Alls signs can once again effect scaled enemies above baselvl+50 where baselvl is initial player level when completing the base game.
  * Aard can now apply its secondary knockdown (and freezing if applicable) effect. Before: Scaled enemies would only flinch briefly.
  * Igni can now apply its burn ticks. Before: Scaled enemies did not know what the Rock was cooking.
  * Yrden can slow its enemies. Before: Yrden did nothing more than embezzle the floor past baselvl+50.
  * Quen can now block more than one hit (with maxed possible magic equipment and potions).
* Improved the balance of Gwent decks and AI usage of cards.
  * Added more swarm abilities to Monster Cards with no prior utility nor power.
  * Added multi-lane and revival abilities to Elf deck to combat power creep from Skellige deck.
  * Northern Realm & Nilfgaardians: largely untouched by toned down some power numbers as they are the strongest decks.
  * Skellige: utilized mushroom transformation abilities more widely in its schema.
* Fixed Ancient Leshen Decoction internal values to do what it says on the item card.
* Allow any Mutagen in slotted anywhere because green Mutagen was the strongest option. Looking at you Euphoria.
* Fixed missing cutscene option in Ciri and Thaler storyline.
* Arachnomorph are now properly classified as insectoids.
